    <h1>Postcss-loader POC</h1>
    <p style="max-width: 700px;">I'm using a react plugin that I know that contains a postcss file. But It doesn't do anything in this POC. When building autoprefixer will show a warning that the postcss.config.js file has a deprecated property and we should use a browserslist file. This file is present in this project. So this is how I know it still looks at postcss config files of imported css files from node_modules dir.</p>
